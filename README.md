# My-Awesome-Portfolio


## Description 
This is my new and improved portfolio made with ReactJS. I was motivated to remake this to make my portfolio with the latest technology in the industry as well as make something that is dynamically generated and more fluid for the user. I also made this to showcase myself as a developer, portraying my deployed projects, having an about me section, and having a contact form to let employers have a way to contact me.
